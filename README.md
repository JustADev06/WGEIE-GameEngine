# **WGEIE-GameEngine**  
### *Worst Game Engine In Existence (no, seriously)*

Welcome to **WGEIE**, which proudly stands for **Worst Game Engine In Existence**.  
Yes, that’s the actual name. Yes, the engine deserves it.

This repo is basically me over-engineering everything that shouldn’t be over-engineered, duct-taping systems together that don’t belong together, and pretending it’s “architecture.”  
If it works — cool.  
If it crashes — also cool.



## **What this thing is**
- A “game engine,” technically  
- A pile of C++ held together by hope  
- SDL glued onto some math code  
- A place for me to break things and call it “learning”  
- Over-engineered in all the wrong places



## **What this thing is NOT**
- Good  
- Stable  
- Documented  
- Ready for anyone else to use ever  
- A serious engine of any kind



## **Features (lol)**
- Makes a window (most of the time)  
- Has a renderer that doesn’t immediately explode  
- Has systems that communicate (badly)  
- Architecture that looked fine at 3AM  
- Enough code to feel like an engine, not enough to *be* one



## **Building this monstrosity**

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
